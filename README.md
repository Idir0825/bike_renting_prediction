# Introduction

This project demonstrates a production-oriented machine learning pipeline built entirely in a local environment.
It covers data ingestion, feature engineering, model training and inference, with a strong focus on Dockerization 
and CI/CD automation.

The goal is not model performance, but showcasing ML engineering best practices.
